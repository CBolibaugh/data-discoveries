<p style="margin:15px;text-align: center;">Data science is one of the most in-demand skills in the world today, and you will likely use it more than you think. <br>
  Data Discoveries is a two-week interdisciplinary showcase that will explore how data is used in both research and industry. <br>
  With events and talks spanning a wide range of subjects, you'll have the chance to network, appreciate the breadth of data science at York, and pick up an idea or two for your own data challenges. <br>
  Join us at the University of York, between <b> Monday 19th and Friday 30th June </b> for an exciting series of events celebrating all things data! </p>

<p>   </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Look out for our DIVINE Data competition, with prizes up for grabs! </b> </p>
