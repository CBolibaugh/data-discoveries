<p style="text-align: center";> <b> 19th - 30th June 2023 </b> </p>

<p style="margin:15px;text-align: center;">Data science is one of the most in-demand skills in the world today, and you will likely use it more than you think. Data Discoveries is a two-week interdisciplinary showcase that will explore how data is used in both research and industry. With events and talks spanning a wide range of subjects, you'll have the chance to network, appreciate the breadth of data science at York, and pick up an idea or two for your own data challenges.
Join us at the University of York, between <b> Monday 19th and Friday 30th June </b> for an exciting series of events celebrating all things data! </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Look out for our DIVINE Data competition, with prizes up for grabs! </b> </p>
